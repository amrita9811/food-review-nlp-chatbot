# food-review-nlp-chatbot
An intelligent chatbot that analyzes customer reviews from multiple sources (Zomato, Google Reviews, etc.) and answers natural language questions about food joints. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and NLP to provide human-like, sentiment-aware responses.

 Key Features
1. Semantic Review Search: Understands meaning, not just keywords.
2. Sentiment-Aware Responses: Answers questions like “Which place has the worst service?”.
3. Multi-source Ingestion: Accepts reviews from CSVs, PDFs, or scraped sources.
4. RAG Pipeline: Combines document retrieval with LLM-based generation for contextual answers.
